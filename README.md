## Background
VetCT is a leading teleradiology and teleconsulting provider to the veterinary industry.

Clients (the veterinary clinic that has referred the patient to us) request medical referrals from VetCT, these are called "cases".  For the purposes of this exercise, a case refers to a specific instance of an animal being examined remotely by one of our specialists.

Cases are invoiced on a monthly basis to the client.
